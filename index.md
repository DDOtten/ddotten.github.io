# About

I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), part of the [Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), and member of the [Mathematical and Computational Logic Unit](https://www.illc.uva.nl/Research/Organisation/Research-Units/MCL/).
My supervisors are [Benno van den Berg](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.vandenberg3/) and [Herman Geuvers](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/).

My main interest is type theory, which I study using tools from category theory.
A central objective is proving conservativity results: showing that minimalistic versions of type theory can already derive the same statements as more complex versions.
These results allows for flexibility: simple versions are easier to model and study, while more extensive versions are convenient to work in and therefore implemented by proof assistents.
An example of such a result is our paper: [Conservativity of Type Theory over Higher-order Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15288).
Other interests include: higher-order logic, constructive mathematics, cyclic proofs, proof assistants, and homotopy theory.
